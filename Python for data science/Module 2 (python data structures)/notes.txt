- Tuples:
t = ()
can contain any data in one tuple
it's immutable -> cannot change them

- Lists:
l = []
lists like tuple expect it's a mmutable -> can change them

- Sets:
s = {  }
set is like tuples and list it's can contain different python types
unlike lists and tuple sets are unordered
sets only have unique elements
Venn digram used to represent a set

- Dictionaries:
d = {"keys": value}
dict has key and variables
keys are immutable and unique
values are mmutable and can be duplicated
